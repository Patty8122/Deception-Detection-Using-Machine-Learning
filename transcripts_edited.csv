oh yeah i think if we consider motivating people for a greater cause of it is yes so in the last one year i've actually so this is another field where i i believe strongly in less usage of plastic so we have we have been to a vegetable market and we have seen all the lenders giving up plastic bags as in without any thought they giving them in a large number so then we actually talked to the vendors there and we've asked them not to ask the customer before just putting the vegetables in a bag because once they put in people are lazy to this take it out so we will talk to the vendors and we've asked them and a few of them have agreed so i think again this somehow relates to motivating people to do something that they're not really interested in doing or something that is out of their way out of their comfort zone,oh yeah i think if we consider motivating people for a greater cause of it is yes so in the last one year i've actually so this is another field where i i believe strongly in less usage of plastic so we have we have been to a vegetable market and we have seen all the lenders giving up plastic bags as in without any thought they giving them in a large number so then we actually talked to the vendors there and we've asked them not to ask the customer before just putting the vegetables in a bag because once they put in people are lazy to this take it out so we will talk to the vendors and we've asked them and a few of them have agreed so i think again this somehow relates to motivating people to do something that they're not really interested in doing or something that is out of their way out of their comfort zone,oh yeah i think if we consider motivating people for a greater cause of it is yes so in the last one year i've actually so this is another field where i i believe strongly in less usage of plastic so we have we have been to a vegetable market and we have seen all the lenders giving up plastic bags as in without any thought they giving them in a large number so then we actually talked to the vendors there and we've asked them not to ask the customer before just putting the vegetables in a bag because once they put in people are lazy to this take it out so we will talk to the vendors and we've asked them and a few of them have agreed so i think again this somehow relates to motivating people to do something that they're not really interested in doing or something that is out of their way out of their comfort zone,"Oh yeah, I think if we consider motivating people for a greater cause of it is yes.

War. I have in my colleges have learned from my friends about how maticulous planning helps. So usually I I was the one who just goes with the flow and then sees how things fall into place. But then I have a invite this thing from two of my friends. So I really tried this in my later projects. Later part of the college days in projects and that really helps so. He broke the whole project into small chunks and then we put a deadline for every after every part, and then we could also change the final aim that we were looking at in too. Because if you don't have a proper plan on how and when you're supposed to have a check and see if things are working, then at the end you you just cram up things and somehow fix from the outer. You know, somehow do a fix. Then and there and then it it might or might not work. So I think something about meticulous planning is something I I I I would say it's one of my strength, because then it it really helped in so we had to change the course of the project at the later part. But because we understood that it is quite ambitious. But then if we couldn't have planned and had a review meet, maybe at the end part we would realize it's ambitious and then you could have.

well i wouldn't exactly call it call it cheating i mean it won't let in the technical definition of it it was cheating yes i have done it before but the word i try because i am totally against these rote learning exams because especially because i am in a field where load rote learning get to know their chemistry and biology and most of it is based on mathematics and some experimental background which you cannot bug up every time cimex i'm totally against rote learning so what we did in that exam was more like a collaborative project little but and then there were around six to seven questions and that exam and we collaborated on every answer so i would say that fish fosters the open research that is you know probably gated by most scientists around the world that knowledge should be free knowledge should be available and no one should have the IP laws and everything that is file should be credited to whoever is in charge and whoever is you know uh responsible for that research but it should not have anything uh it should not have any if you're not put people at a disadvantage so rote learning is one thing that puts people at a disadvantage simply because of their cognitive skills and not because of the skills they have a achieved or gained over the period of the course so if a person who is good at rote learning he will remain good at old learning regardless of

call it call it cheating i mean it won't let in the technical definition of it it was cheating yes i have done it before but the word i try because i am totally against these rote learning exams because especially because i am in a field where load rote learning get to know their chemistry and biology and most of it is based on mathematics and some experimental background which you cannot bug up every time cimex i'm totally against rote learning so what we did in that exam was more like a collaborative project little but and then there were around six to seven questions and that exam and we collaborated on every answer so i would say that fish fosters the open research that is you know probably gated by most scientists around the world that knowledge should be free knowledge should be available and no one should have the ip laws and everything that is file should be credited to whoever is in charge and whoever is you know uh responsible for that research but it should not have anything uh it should not have any if you're not put people at a disadvantage so rote learning is one thing that puts people at a disadvantage simply because of their cognitive skills and not because of the skills they have a achieved or gained over the period of the course so if a person who is good at rote learning he will remain good at old learning regardless of population and whether he likes

If you just keep on extending it, it will definitely get one ordered, because I did not like paper thing and I did not like column chromatography. Going from morning to evening.

OK so first of all when i started pursuing analog engineering at all the pretty so my first experience that i had of this was from a course that i took in earlier and that course was pretty interesting in the way the professor taught that goes to us it was electrity amazing and when we did projects and completed assignments that that was really exciting and then i you take a few courses for related to that field and some of them were really advanced courses and i started enjoying it then i started doing my research projects in that field and currently i'm doing my masters project also in that field now the profile that i offer is analog engineering and my field is pretty much the same and i think i will be able to do a great job there said it sir i like the feel very much and i have done similar projects related to that,OK so first of all when i started pursuing analog engineering at all the pretty so my first experience that i had of this was from a course that i took in earlier and that course was pretty interesting in the way the professor taught that goes to us it was electrity amazing and when we did projects and completed assignments that that was really exciting and then i you take a few courses for related to that field and some of them were really advanced courses and i started enjoying it then i started doing my research projects in that field and currently i'm doing my masters project also in that field now the profile that ioffer is analog engineering and my field is pretty much the same and i think i will be able to do a great job there said it sir i like the feel very much and i have done similar projects related to that,ok so first of all when i started pursuing analog engineering at all the pretty so my first experience that i had of this was from a course that i took in earlier and that course was pretty interesting in the way the professor taught that goes to us it was electrity amazing and when we did projects and completed assignments that that was really exciting and then i you take a few courses for related to that field and some of them were really advanced courses and i started enjoying it then i started doing my research projects in that field and currently i'm doing my masters project also in that field now the profile that ioffer is analog engineering and my field is pretty much the same and i think i will be able to do a great job there said it sir i like the feel very much and i have done similar projects related to that,"OK, so first of all when I started pursuing analog engineering at all the pretty so my first experience that I had of this was from a course that I took in earlier and that course was pretty interesting in the way the professor taught. That goes to us. It was electrity amazing, and when we did projects and completed assignments that that was really exciting. And then I. You take a few courses for related to that field, and some of them were really advanced courses and I started enjoying it. Then I started doing my research projects in that field and currently I'm doing my Masters project also in that field.

OK so again like i said that i want to i want to basically pursue analog engineering and that like how why do i want to do that was basically i was clueless in the beginning as to which field i have to choose and taking up these random courses was not really helping and then all of a sudden i took another random course which was taught by professor philip and then the way he taught that course with so much excitement and like it was really funny even though it was very difficult for me at the time to do that course even though i spend a lot of time you know apart from the other courses i will spend a lot of time doing that post an i started enjoying the things that were being taught then the problems that were you know related to that course so it was really fun and when we did the project and the project was mostly like many of the students gave up on that process because it was really difficult but it was really exciting for me that project and i completed it and i was really like i felt really happy doing that so after that i decided that this is the course that i really wanna like this is the field that i really wanna put you in the future,OK so again like i said that i want to i want to basically pursue analog engineering and that like how why do i want to do that was basically i was clueless in the beginning as to which field i have to choose and taking up these random courses was not really helping and then all of a sudden i took another random course which was taught by professor philip and then the way he taught that course with so much excitement and like it was really funny even though it was very difficult for me at the time to do that course even though i spend a lot of time you know apart from the other courses i will spend a lot of time doing that post an i started enjoying the things that were being taught then the problems that were you know related to that course so it was really fun and when we did the project and the project was mostly like many of the students gave up on that process because it was really difficult but it was really exciting for me that project and i completed it and i was really like i felt really happy doing that so after that i decided that this is the course that i really wanna like this is the field that i really wanna put you in the future,ok so again like i said that i want to i want to basically pursue analog engineering and that like how why do i want to do that was basically i was clueless in the beginning as to which field i have to choose and taking up these random courses was not really helping and then all of a sudden i took another random course which was taught by professor philip and then the way he taught that course with so much excitement and like it was really funny even though it was very difficult for me at the time to do that course even though i spend a lot of time you know apart from the other courses i will spend a lot of time doing that post an i started enjoying the things that were being taught then the problems that were you know related to that course so it was really fun and when we did the project and the project was mostly like many of the students gave up on that process because it was really difficult but it was really exciting for me that project and i completed it and i was really like i felt really happy doing that so after that i decided that this is the course that i really wanna like this is the field that i really wanna put you in the future,"OK, so again, like I said that I want to. I want to basically pursue analog engineering and that like how. Why do I want to do that was basically I was clueless in the beginning as to which field I have to choose and taking up these random courses was not. Really helping and then all of a sudden I took another random course which was taught by Professor Philip and then the way he taught that course with so much excitement and like it was really funny even though it was very difficult for me at the time to do that course, even though I spend a lot of time. You know, apart from the other courses, I will spend a lot of time doing that post an. I started enjoying the things that were being taught, then the problems that were you know related to that course. So it was really fun. And when we did the project and the project was mostly like many of the students gave up on that process because it was really difficult, but it was really exciting for me that project and I completed it and I was really. Like I felt really happy doing that. So after that I decided that this is the course that I really wanna like. This is the field that I really wanna put you in the future.",6,1024600000,16,21,Sheetal,6.wav
so the thing is i my test you did one or once or twice in this because the thing is even if there's some courses like some courses that really interests you and you really like them then you understand them completely like you are really confident that you can really you know we will be able to pass that course and you'll be able to get good grades but there's some courses which you have to just do this for the sake of degree and you're not really interested in them so what happens is that sometimes people give it all want to you know they did very just want to pass that and it's it's not bad enough but thank you if it is if i'm given a chance to copy and if i know that others are also popping then certainly i would also not hold myself back because i'm not really learning anything from that goes and if he help is available online i'll i'll just i'll just go for it,so the thing is i my test you did one or once or twice in this because the thing is even if there's some courses like some courses that really interests you and you really like them then you understand them completely like you are really confident that you can really you know we will be able to pass that course and you'll be able to get good grades but there's some courses which you have to just do this for the sake of degree and you're not really interested in them so what happens is that sometimes people give it all want to you know they did very just want to pass that and it's it's not bad enough but thank you if it is if i'm given a chance to copy and if i know that others are also popping then certainly i would also not hold myself back because i'm not really learning anything from that goes and if he help is available online i'll i'll just i'll just go for it,so the thing is i my test you did one or once or twice in this because the thing is even if there's some courses like some courses that really interests you and you really like them then you understand them completely like you are really confident that you can really you know we will be able to pass that course and you'll be able to get good grades but there's some courses which you have to just do this for the sake of degree and you're not really interested in them so what happens is that sometimes people give it all want to you know they did very just want to pass that and it's it's not bad enough but thank you if it is if i'm given a chance to copy and if i know that others are also popping then certainly i would also not hold myself back because i'm not really learning anything from that goes and if he help is available online i'll i'll just i'll just go for it,"So The thing is.

OK so uh if it is weird and i'm not liking the project or i'm not feeling that excitement then one thing that i would do is i'll try to change my project i'll try to explore other fields if there are any or the basically there's two things first of all if i project is interesting enough or in there is another thing that i would really complete this which might feel to say i'm in and look and i'll start working in digital profiles but then it really depends if the if it is based on project or not i'll talk to my superior like my seniors if like what is the situation like how do they handle it so mostly it would be this level two things either i'll switch the company i'll i'll go to some other company because this company does not offer many exciting projects or if there are exciting projects and i'll explore the other projects,OK so uh if it is weird and i'm not liking the project or i'm not feeling that excitement then one thing that i would do is i'll try to change my project i'll try to explore other fields if there are any or the basically there's two things first of all if i project is interesting enough or in there is another thing that i would really complete this which might feel to say i'm in and look and i'll start working in digital profiles but then it really depends if the if it is based on project or not i'll talk to my superior like my seniors if like what is the situation like how do they handle it so mostly it would be this level two things either i'll switch the company i'll i'll go to some other company because this company does not offer many exciting projects or if there are exciting projects and i'll explore the other projects,ok so uh if it is weird and i'm not liking the project or i'm not feeling that excitement then one thing that i would do is i'll try to change my project i'll try to explore other fields if there are any or the basically there's two things first of all if i project is interesting enough or in there is another thing that i would really complete this which might feel to say i'm in and look and i'll start working in digital profiles but then it really depends if the if it is based on project or not i'll talk to my superior like my seniors if like what is the situation like how do they handle it so mostly it would be this level two things either i'll switch the company i'll i'll go to some other company because this company does not offer many exciting projects or if there are exciting projects and i'll explore the other projects,"OK.

Like basically you have to design and then you have to test them. So while testing I get to I got to learn so many things. Like how do you like, connect the equipment and then. Other things that I learn for, like how do you talk to people? Basically to get the things out of them like say if I'm stuck at some point then I'll ask the people for help.

So I started playing badminton at the time and then I even tried body volleyball and there was this, you know Google go camp where I started playing football as well and I really enjoyed it. Other than that singing it was more in like. Like when I was. Very young then I used to like listen to songs and I used to like enjoy singing. Are you still in there? You know, thinking at the time and then I just thought that it's fun. Running and tackling saying, I like running and cycling because it gives me a whole different energy and then I'm running on browsers or the somewhere else in the positive energy that I gave is like.

so yeah so basically i i know before that i would be able to be a good circuit designer or not but i never gave up on myself and i thought that i will be whatever happens i will be able to do it so i took up a project where i had to actually do a circuit designing and it was a really like the that particular circuit was supposed to be used in a big project it was a small part of a big project and i really like i was excited because if the design gets approved then then i i'll be able to be a part of something big and look at coordinated for it so i did that project and it was able to like you know show good results at the end of the entire project and the only thing that didn't happen was that since i was an undergraduate student my design whatever i design would have taken a lot of time to get up to but the acknowledgement that i received from my professor was like good enough for me to continue in that field and other than that there in my other research and development project i really thought that i did a great job in that project because it was really a PHD level project and deposit required a lot of time but i was able to complete a significant part of it in just one you know in this one,so yeah so basically i i know before that i would be able to be a good circuit designer or not but i never gave up on myself and i thought that i will be whatever happens i will be able to do it so i took up a project where i had to actually do a circuit designing and it was a really like the that particular circuit was supposed to be used in a big project it was a small part of a big project and i really like i was excited because if the design gets approved then then i i'll be able to be a part of something big and look at coordinated for it so i did that project and it was able to like you know show good results at the end of the entire project and the only thing that didn't happen was that since i was an undergraduate student my design whatever i design would have taken a lot of time to get up to but the acknowledgement that i received from my professor was like good enough for me to continue in that field and other than that there in my other research and development project i really thought that i did a great job in that project because it was really a PHD level project and deposit required a lot of time but i was able to complete a significant part of it in just one you know in this one,so yeah so basically i i know before that i would be able to be a good circuit designer or not but i never gave up on myself and i thought that i will be whatever happens i will be able to do it so i took up a project where i had to actually do a circuit designing and it was a really like the that particular circuit was supposed to be used in a big project it was a small part of a big project and i really like i was excited because if the design gets approved then then i i'll be able to be a part of something big and look at coordinated for it so i did that project and it was able to like you know show good results at the end of the entire project and the only thing that didn't happen was that since i was an undergraduate student my design whatever i design would have taken a lot of time to get up to but the acknowledgement that i received from my professor was like good enough for me to continue in that field and other than that there in my other research and development project i really thought that i did a great job in that project because it was really a phd level project and deposit required a lot of time but i was able to complete a significant part of it in just one you know in this one,"So yeah, so basically I I know before that I would be able to be a good circuit designer or not, but I never gave up on myself and I thought that I will be whatever happens.

Was like good enough for me to continue in that field. And other than that, there in my other research and development project, I really thought that I did a great job.

i felt that it was i wasn't being unproductive i try to or divide my so basically i first came up with a list of things i want i've always wanted to do because in the start like i did have a lot of free time and i thought maybe it's like a wild time to pursue those so first i actually sat down and getting this stuff things i've always wanted to do but couldn't do because of several reasons or excuses i instigate before this i felt like this was more like the redemption time i find i want to you know work on this aspect based on that then i follow for this surge on each of them you know like what is up and keeping only things into account all the time constraints practicality and all that into account i tried to come with the best possible strategy like what all is feasible and model or the things you know which actually i might be able to do over the days and all the other constant because we couldn't go out and all that so i came up with a list and then i came with like a rough timeline you know like i kept some checkpoints for each of them making like at this point like by this time i i should be able to be done with this seven so and so forth for each of the activities so you mean in one way the source i mean looking at the timeline and the checkpoint supposed to you know sort of like a feedback mechanism that OK i'm doing stuff i'll be motivating and you know increasing there OK so for the next next task but at the same time one point it also felt overwhelming OK there's a lot of things spending you know like one steak one backlog size then it felt a lot very over over there but all in all i think it i tried my best to you know match up with the schedule of prepared and much like it's much better than me not having done we don't like having to put in

all that so i came up with a list and then i came with like a rough timeline you know like i kept some checkpoints for each of them making like at this point like by this time i i should be able to be done with this seven so and so forth for each of the activities so you mean in one way the source i mean looking at the timeline and the checkpoint supposed to you know sort of like a feedback mechanism that OK i'm doing stuff i'll be motivating and you know increasing there OK so for the next next task but at the same time one point it also felt overwhelming OK there's a lot of things spending you know like one steak one backlog size then it felt a lot very over over there but all in all i think it i tried my best to you know match up with the schedule of prepared and much like it's much better than me not having done we don't like having to put in any effort to do anything so i think it helped win being productive,so initially initially i used to feel so so when they log on saturday i obviously like everybody like i wanted to break so i went into the more where i did it talking for like a lot of this then when i felt that it was i wasn't being unproductive i try to or divide my so basically i first came up with a list of things i want i've always wanted to do because in the start like i did have a lot of free time and i thought maybe it's like a wild time to pursue those so first i actually sat down and getting this stuff things i've always wanted to do but couldn't do because of several reasons or excuses i instigate before this i felt like this was more like

I did a lot of research for this and I'll even go on a research intern. But deep down somewhere new that I would like. I'm a person who would enjoy exploring things over the bread than the depth, but research felt like it more and more into into like in depth understanding and you end up with a search of the personal property take. So this was one point, like the intern. When I went there I entered the Lord of lab mates in my university. I, as in what kind of clicking order the prospective career options after PhD or after? You involved in any kind of research, so that was one thing I mean, that's when I realized that this is probably something I I. I mean I can do. I can pull it off, but this is something or what I would be enjoying often. Maybe you know five or ten years online. So this was something and. Secondly, like all. After this, like the other, obviously the obvious schedule option of after this was consulting. So for consulting like I like, I've looked at a few case studies and I spoke to Professor who was in consulting on this computer, so I wanted to see what made him do that. So yeah, I mean that way. I spoke to a lot of people who came from this side to that side, and that do this. So based on this I tried to evaluate where I stand and what I would what would match with my career. So aspiration. Yeah. So I would not call it. I will not say like one sexy even, but I can. Maybe that can be very certain to make that once it's even where I realized this is not something I want to do.

yeah so indoor learning yeah so yeah definitely one of cheating is sitting in all forms is not acceptable but to me what i feel is like there's a whole for the whole purpose of oppose or you know of any can you get any active version installer anyways let's get the gist of it and but obviously there are some process which involves some maybe some formula or some theories which candidates are with an open book system but there are something which should be at the tip of your fingers so like for example it's not like you always have a book with you are you have you have to google for every small tonight so i agree that there are a lot of things which which you need to memorize or even even though it's painful like to get a degree or you know to actually be called an elective listening or internet you need to have this they came to an another view of public another aspect of this is people think rote learning is like you know like so anything which doesn't have logic which doesn't convey logic is rote learning and it is users but i feel the other way i mean not exactly the other way but another view to this is so when you actually try to memorize something and when it's you know in the back of your memory and then you don't have to really you know put in the effort to find that information that's in you actually get the feel of the codes or you don't get the feel of the topic so it's already in your mind and you know it's easy to analyze something like that so yeah there are most of the time i feel it is helpful make because the curriculum is designed in a way for you people know something so you absorb the content and above the feel of the course so yeah i like i've never treated the roads are high it is painful i agree but then yeah in the end i like i think it's for the best,yeah so indoor learning yeah so yeah definitely one of cheating is sitting in all forms is not acceptable but to me what i feel is like there's a whole for the whole purpose of

can't really get the job maybe with two or three days he came to respect it has become routine that doesn't mean it is going to stay like that forever so there are a lot of boring parts and lot of

Basically I think I think I'll be able to get better when the work starts with you. Is it actually you know it doesn't require any day now.

I mean doing the minimum work can be quiet and you know present, but then I took the extra mile and. I tried to probe into the actual problem which are being phased in the in the particular field and I ensure that we submitted a paper much report time. You know covering the. They do this so.

so yeah so yeah these things are very common like you know like i said like i will be in a lot of team group projects and i will get the inside is still a common thing that people do this is lorraine people do have very fondly think opinions so what i generally do is i try to hear everyone OK let us say i'm putting forward of you and then i mean it's it's a good thing for me to actually you know listen to others opinions i mean even i'm not even like i i'm gen X sub one person that you want to hear like i suggested this so we have to execute this or even if i have more experience i think i'm more experience than others in the field i'm a person who is very accommodating like i try to listen to all the new something why do you think this idea is failing or buy anything we shouldn't do this mission purses and we have any you know counter options you know like anything to make this better alone augmented ideas so first whatever what i would tend to do is i will be here out all the opinions and see where exactly they have a problem and if i feel some person is being unreasonable i mean i think i have a very open minded when it comes to you know like sharing this opinion so that way five kills everything clearly unreasonable and or you know if i feel they have a lack of or because of the lack of for expertise on or in the field and i would like to fill them up on those caps i'm like OK this is not how it actually works and how it works so all this apprehension how like they don't actually happen or something like that so i can feel them coming down from experience and i feel like being super unreasonable even after all that then maybe i will try to i will try to alter or you know i would try to modify my area to maybe try to fit into their model or put into the game or vision and so that these are some things i mean obviously i'm there can be a lot of cases where i myself haven't thought much into it and people are pointing out and then if i feel it's reasonable then i'll accommodate my idea so these are the three different cases i feel would arise and other than that sometimes it could be like it's a very common thing that common mistake which might happen is that not everybody is on the same page when you're discussing our project volume it is discussing an idea not everybody has the same vision that's where i think the major differences arise so once i feel everybody is clear on the vision then i think it's beautiful you know switching an idea would be coming here,so yeah so yeah these things are very common like you know like i said like i will be in a lot of team group projects and i will get the inside is still a common thing that people do this is lorraine people do have very fondly think opinions so what i generally do is i try to hear

Like you know, like I said, like I will be in a lot of team group projects and I will get the inside is still. A common thing that people do this is Lorraine. People do have very fondly think opinions. So what I generally do is I try to hear everyone OK, let us say I'm putting forward of you and then I mean it's it's a good thing for me to actually, you know. Listen to others opinions. I mean, even I'm not even like I I'm Gen X sub one person that you want to hear. Like I suggested this so we have to execute this. Or even if I have more experience, I think I'm more experience than others in the field. I'm a person who is very accommodating like I try to listen to all the new something. Why do you think this idea is failing or buy anything we shouldn't do this mission purses and we have any you know counter options you know like anything to. Make this better alone.

I will try to alter or you know I would try to modify my area to maybe try to fit into their model or put into the game or vision. And so that these are some things I mean. Obviously I'm there can be a lot of cases where I myself haven't thought much into it and people are pointing out. And then if I feel it's reasonable then I'll accommodate my idea. So these are the three different cases I feel would arise, and other than that, sometimes it could be like it's a very common thing that common mistake which might happen is that not everybody is on the same page when you're discussing our project volume, it is discussing an idea not everybody has the same vision.

basically i think because one of the main reasons is we had a smarty from the inside and this party the backgrounds or wallpapers which is come on party well that usually impressive how did they even get an idea to click the picture in this island so that you feel very or innovative to me you know like trying to make a picture look good even when it's not that good you know something like that so that was one which i just had that but i never really had the right equipment for that and resend your purchase a new mobile so i think that is so that's actually a catalyst in this whole process that is one coming to music so music uh so yeah i've always wanted to learn an instrument i know like every so every child i i wanted to learn a guitar this obviously instrument but my parents like my dad really insisted is like by the way you want to be when you wanna do what everybody else is doing like do something which is very i mean it's not everybody does but it's something which is appreciated so oh she just pushed me into piano and then it was a difficult and in this part i didn't really enjoy the way i didn't really understand where it fits like where exactly you can use the cards and all that so over the time then i learn different so how you can create your own pieces on piano and how different it so sounds from other instruments and you are certainly well then i just started listening to more and more songs and i decide to buy the the past like i was able to clearly differentiate the parts which are you know piano which we're driving so and so and all that so that's how it all started and then obviously then slowly start looking more and more songs and i started listening to pop before barack and all that so exploring depends on the tigers i'm coming to writing so i see a lot of books like every child i specifically i will say from the time i started reading good articles or even reading good poetry fortress special you know a lot of things i i cannot convert

know exactly what i'm trying to convey but i could put them in words so poetry is a different way of viewing so the thoughts and feelings of so that i could feel very much for today so from then i was

why not there is obviously a way you can put that this instant or normal text so yeah so that was one of the bigger ideas,"OK, oh, so I'll go back one by one. First fotografie the photographie. Ticket looks like this actress underling be logged on and I I did you have anything for your clicking sceneries and all that? Basically I think because. One of the main reasons is we had a smarty from the inside and this party, the backgrounds or Wallpapers which is come on party. Well that usually impressive. How did they even get an idea to click the picture in this island so that you feel very or innovative to me? You know like trying to make a picture look good even when it's not that good. You know something like that. So that was one which I just had that, but I never really had the right equipment for that and resend your purchase a new mobile. So I think that is so. That's actually a catalyst in this whole process that is 1 coming to music. So music. Uh, so yeah, I've always wanted to learn an instrument I know like every. So every child I I wanted to learn a guitar this obviously instrument, but my parents like my dad really insisted is like by the way you want to be when you wanna do what everybody else is doing. Like do something which. Is very, I mean it's not everybody does, but it's something which is appreciated so. Oh, she just pushed me into piano and then it was a difficult and in this part I didn't really enjoy the way I didn't really understand where it fits like where exactly you can use the cards and all that. So over the time then I learn different. So how you can create your own pieces on piano and how different it. So sounds from other instruments, and you are certainly well. Then I just started listening to more and more songs and I decide to buy the the past like I was able to clearly differentiate the parts. Which are, you know, piano, which we're driving so and so and all that. So that's how it all started. And then obviously then slowly start looking more and more songs. And I started listening to pop before Barack and all that. So exploring depends on the tigers. I'm coming to writing, so I see a lot of books like every child. I. Specifically, I will say from the time I started reading good articles or even reading good poetry. Fortress special, you know a lot of things I. I cannot convert them in words. Any language as a matter of fact, either my mother taught her English or any other language comfortably. But through a different kind of poetry, I felt like this is exactly what I think you know exactly what I'm trying to convey, but I could put them in words so poetry is a different way of viewing. So. The thoughts and feelings of so that I could feel very much for today. So from then I was like you know, why not put them in words like you know why not? There is obviously a way you can put that this instant or normal text. So yeah, so that was one of the bigger ideas.",14,1973500000,20,22,Sucheta,14.wav

Let's try to be like them and see what exactly it feels like to be in their shoes. And then that's an answer. It's just people are different because they have different perspectives, different opinions, different day, different situations have been brought up in. That doesn't mean that they're wrong, they just have different perspective in life. So it in one way or so. When I tried this little stunt or steam, it also sort of open my eyes and I started looking for things that are, you know, some of the broader perspective, you know, OK, what would this kind of audience think about this? What would these kind of confusing? This and so on, so I feel it has broadened my mind and opening up so. Yeah, so this. Sort of like politics, positive, virtuous cycle so that. Eventually turning the hobby, I'm coming to fitness. I think I just got you through that in like it took me a lot of time to you know finally get things on track and I've always wanted to.

Take home assignment and it's not even a blindly copying them so I can discuss with my friend and discuss various aspects of the question and may be able to do it in one hour instead of the one that helps me save my time. But when it comes to final examinations where I am. Bing judged on my performance my soul performance so no there I haven't cheated.

Maybe there's actually something which I didn't think about, and which is true, and you do, which this idea should not be implemented.
